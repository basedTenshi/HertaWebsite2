  <h2>About Madam Herta</h2>

    <p>Esteemed member #83 of the Genius Society, human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
       It's said that she lives in the far edge of the Cosmos, almost never leaving. 
       Sounds like her appearance this time... 
       must be to deal with an issue that has to be handled herself, right?
       She collaborated with Screwllum, Ruan Mei, and 
       Stephen Lloyd to create the Simulated Universe, 
       in order to research the mysterious nature of Aeons. 
       She is also an Emanator of Nous the Erudition.

<h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Herta (Puppet Form):
       Herta is a member of the Genius Society, designated as #83. 
       She exists primarily as a ball-jointed puppet that represents her younger self. 
       This puppet operates as the master of the Herta Space Station, a scientific research facility in the Blue system. 
       Known for her exceptional intellect and detachment, 
       Herta frequently abandons projects once they cease to stimulate her interest. 
       She controls her puppets remotely, perceiving their environment but limiting their functionality.
    </p>

    <p>The Herta (True Form):
       Beneath the puppet facade lies The Herta, the true and original form—an emanator of the Aeon of Erudition, 
       known as Nous. She resides deep within the Clock Tower at the edge of the cosmos, 
       devoted to solving the universe’s most profound mysteries. 
       To protect herself and her work from threats within the Genius Society, she remains hidden, 
       delegating routine tasks to her puppets while focusing on her research.
